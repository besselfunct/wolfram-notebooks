#### Install the stylesheet

1. The stylesheet is titled "Nord.nb". Move the stylesheet to folder where your Wolfram Desktop application is installed, and into SystemFiles. Run this code to open the folder:

        SystemOpen[FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory,"SystemFiles","FrontEnd","StyleSheets"}]]

You may need to restart your application to see the changes take effect.

2. Open a new notebook, and from the menu go to Format > Stylesheet > Nord to change the stylesheet to Nord.
