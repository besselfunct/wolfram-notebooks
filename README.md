## Credit Where Credit is Due
This theme is a shameless fork of Jesse Dohmann's excellent Dracula theme (https://github.com/dracula/wolfram-notebooks).
I just changed a few RGB values, she did a bunch of heavy-lifting getting the stylesheet up and running and in a place where I could modify it.
Massive thanks to her for doing this, and making it public!

## Note
This theme is not complete.
I'm not nearly as competent with Mathematica as I'd like to be, so there are still some holes (like the coloration of the Wolfram|Alpha prompt).
Additionally, I didn't follow the Nord theme guidelines exactly.
I'll probably revisit this after using it for a while, and switch some of the colors around.
