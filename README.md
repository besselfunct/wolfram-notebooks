## Install

## Credit Where Credit is Due
This theme is a shameless fork of Jesse Dohmann's excellent Dracula theme (https://github.com/dracula/wolfram-notebooks).
I just changed a few RGB values, she did a bunch of heavy-lifting getting the stylesheet up and running and in a place where I could modify it.
Massive thanks to her for doing this, and making it public!
